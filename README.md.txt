# Voice Cloner

This is a voice cloning project using ECAPA-TDNN for speaker embedding, F5-TTS for text-to-speech synthesis, and HiFi-GAN as the vocoder.

## Features
- Speaker embedding using ECAPA-TDNN
- Natural speech synthesis with F5-TTS
- High-quality vocoding with HiFi-GAN

## Usage
1. Clone this repo
2. Follow the steps in `run.py` to test voice cloning

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- torchaudio
- Additional libraries (see `requirements.txt`)
